          <p>"Hi Namrata,</p>
                <p>When I stumbled across ur insta handle, I would relate to a lot of ur reels. I was overwhelmed, frustrated and had so much anger in me about just everything. I came to u with a chaotic mind having not dealt with so many issues that plagued my life. You helped me heal my longstanding trauma so effortlessly.
                </p>
                <p>I now feel peaceful and happy from within. I am very certain that the tools and tips u have given me in this one and half month long journey will stay with me forever. I feel confident that I will be able to help not just myself but I will also be able to empower my near ones.
                </p>
                <p>Thank you for helping me bring out a renewed version of myself and I assure u that I will keep practicing all my learnings. Please continue to do the awesome work you are doing. I wish u all success!"

          <p>Hi Namrata di, 
                </p>
                <p>I am grateful that I met you as my healing therapist.
She made me feel completely at ease discussing anything that was on my mind and express difficult emotions without judging me was a huge relief. We got to the bottom of damaging generational pattern thoughts which we all have and are unaware of those toxic thoughts and worked through simple methods to deal with them, which I feel confident about dealing with emotions on my own rather than looking for someone everytime to validate my feelings. Her patience, understanding and guidance have enabled me to make me feel confident and accept myself the way I am and not look at myself by standing in others shoes and to be authentic will be lasting with me forever. I would definitely recommend her for the healing sessions to break those toxic generational patterns. Thank you so much once again.

          <p>You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only option.
But under that strength lies a lot of unresolved trauma. From my childhood, self help books helped me to a certain extent to soothe me but it was not enough.</p>
                <p>Then i stumbled upon Namrata's blogs on PULA and all her articles resonated so well with me that i had to contact her.
I requested my first session should be in person and she agreed. In my first session itself I realised this is exactly the place where i will get the right help.
</p>
<p>Namrata is extremely patient, understanding and an incredibly empathetic person.
She solved all my problems and made me a new and improved human being ready to take the challenges life has to throw my away. She gave me the confidence and right thought process so that i can be at the best of my potential.
</p>
<p>I would be eternally indebted to all the help she has provided me with. Thank you Namrata!</p>
